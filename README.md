# Alex and Ariel's CSC 426 Networking Project
To run this project, first run the Server script.

```python
python Server.py
```
This script will print out the IP Address of the Server for the user to utilize when running the Client script.

```python
python Client.py [paste the IP Address of the Server here]
```

This will start the game.
